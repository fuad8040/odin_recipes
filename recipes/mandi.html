    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Mandi</strong> is a traditional dish originated from Yemen,
      consisting mainly of meat and rice with a special blend of spices. It is
      cooked in a pit underground. It's extremely popular and prevalent in most
      areas of the Arabian Peninsula. Also in countries like Egypt and others.

      The 3 types of Mandi: mutton madfoon, mutton mandi and chicken madbee.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Hawaij spice blend</li>
      <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        make the Hawaij spice blend so the chicken can have time to marinate.
        Place all the spices (except for the turmeric and bay leaves) into a pan
        and toast them for 2-3 minutes on medium high until you start to smell
        them. Keep an eye out because they burn quickly (I burned my first batch
        sadly).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the spices in a spice or coffee grinder and grind until a fine
        powder forms. You're done!
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can remove two teaspoons of the spice mix and set aside for the
        rice, then use the remaining for the chicken. Mix it with the turmeric
        and salt, then add the olive oil to create a paste. Slather it all over
        the chicken and marinate overnight for maximum flavour. But a few hours
        is fine too.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are ready to start making the dish, thinly slice the onions
        ensuring you slice as evenly as possible. You can use a mandolin if you
        have one. Even sizes help them fry evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a pot, add the oil and then drop in the onions while oil is still
        cold. Fry for 15-20 minutes, stirring them around every few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since we are not deep frying, they won't get extremely crunchy, but
        that's totally fine. This is the simplest method I found that allows you
        to use all the onion infused oil in your rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the onions are golden brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and
        drain on paper towels, but leave approximately 3 tablespoons in the pot
        (to be used for the rice). Be sure to spread them out in one layer to
        give them a chance to crisp up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now its time to make the rice broth. Keep frying up the onions in the
        oil, in the same pot, and add the hawaij spice blend, and the dried
        lime. Before you add the dried lime, pierce them a couple of times with
        a knife (very carefully).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the spices are toasted, add the bay leaves and the water and bring
        to a boil
      </li>
      <li>
        To steam the chicken, place a steaming rack in the pot (or a small
        stainless steel wire rack if you don't have a steamer rack), place the
        chicken on the rack, then cover and steam for 50 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chicken is really tender, remove it from the pot and place it
        on a baking sheet to broil for 10 minutes. This steps gives you a deeply
        golden crust on the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        While doing that, bloom the saffron by grinding them in a mortar and
        pestle then allowing to bloom in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of hot water.
        You will end up with a vibrant yellow liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now its time to strain the broth that was used to steam the chicken.
        Reserve the liquid and measure it out to exactly 1.5 cups of liquid to 1
        cup of rice. Add water to the broth if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the strained broth back into the same pot, then add the turmeric,
        the bloomed saffron and the salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next add the washed and soaked rice (soaking for only 10 minutes), give
        it a good mix, then bring the pot to a boil
      </li>
      <li>
        Once bubbling for a few minutes and most of the liquid has evaporated,
        cover with a paper towel and the pot lid to keep it fresh for longer
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the rice for 20 minutes undisturbed. Then turn the heat off, fluff
        with a fork, then cover and let stand for another 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the rice cooks, quickly fry the almonds and the raisins in a bit
        of olive oil to toast them.
      </li>
